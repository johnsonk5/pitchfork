# Pitchfork Over the Years

## Goal
In this project, I will analyze Pitchfork scores and answer the following questions:
- What score does Pitchfork give most often?
- What genres does Pitchfork review most often?
- Have Pitchfork's Reviews changed over time?

## Data
The data I used for this project was taken from user Nolan Conaway on Kaggle, it can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nolanbconaway/pitchfork-data?select=database.sqlite). The dataset contains 18,393 Pitchfork reviews and a variety of information about them such as the artist, album, genre and date of the review. The reviews in the dataset are all from the years 1999-2017.

## Results
**Scores**

- Most scores were between a 7 and an 8.
- The distribution of scores was fairly consistent over time.

**Genres**

- Rock albums made up nearly half of the reviews in Pitchfork's catalog.
- Between 2011 and 2016, the share of rock albums that Pitchfork reviewed declined by a significant amount.

**Average Scores Over Time**

- The average score has been rising since 2009.
- The rising score is a result of a decline in low scoring albums.
